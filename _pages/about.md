I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [iBRAIN Lab](https://ibrain.nuaa.edu.cn/) at the College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, supervised by [Prof. Daoqiang Zhang](https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/zhangdq/). I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science & Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2021. Moreover, I was a visiting PhD student at the Institute of Infocomm Research, A*STAR, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoli Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/).

My research interests mainly include sensor-based time series, brain-computer interface, domain adaptation, and foundation models/LLMs.
