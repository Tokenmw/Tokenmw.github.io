I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [iBRAIN Lab](https://ibrain.nuaa.edu.cn/) at the College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), supervised by [Prof. Daoqiang Zhang](https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/zhangdq/). I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science & Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU) in 2021. Moreover, I was a visiting PhD student at the Institute of Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaoli Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/).

**Research Interests**: Time Series, Transfer Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Foundation Models/LLMs

My research focuses on developing robust approaches for time series analysis with emphasis on cross-domain generalization. Key applications include Brain-Computer Interfaces (EEG-based cognitive state recognition), human activity recognition, and machine fault diagnosis.
