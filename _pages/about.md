<!-- About Me -->
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: justify;">
<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Pvgwd0AAAAJ">Prof. Yang Liu</a>. Previously, I received my PhD from the <a href="https://ibrain.nuaa.edu.cn/">iBRAIN Lab</a> at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, supervised by <a href="https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/zhangdq/">Prof. Daoqiang Zhang</a>. I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science & Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2021. During my PhD studies, I was a visiting PhD student at the Institute of Infocomm Research, A*STAR, supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/">Prof. Xiaoli Li</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests are broadly in machine learning and primarily focus on:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <li>Sensor-based Time Series Analysis</li>
    <li>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)</li>
    <li>Domain Adaptation</li>
    <li>Foundation Models and Large Language Models (LLMs)</li>
    <li>Neuro AI</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: red; text-align: justify;">
📪If you are interested in collaborating on topics such as Time Series Analysis, BCI, Brain Foundation/LLM Models, and other related areas, I warmly welcome potential collaborators and research interns—feel free to reach out! I also welcome inquiries from CSC scholarship students and visiting students/scholars who are interested in conducting research in these areas.
