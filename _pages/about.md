I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [iBRAIN Lab](https://ibrain.nuaa.edu.cn/) at the College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), supervised by [Prof. Daoqiang Zhang](https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/zhangdq/). I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science & Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU), Beijing, China, in 2021. Moreover, I was a visiting PhD student at the Institute of Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaoli Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/).

My research interests include deep learning, transfer learning, graph neural networks, and foundation models/LLMs, with a primary focus on developing robust approaches for time series data analysis. My research advances cross-domain generalization through novel architectures and adaptation frameworks, with significant applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (e.g., EEG-based cognitive state recognition) and broader time series domains (e.g., human activity recognition and machine fault diagnosis), demonstrating strong capabilities in both theoretical innovation and practical deployment.
